    Mariusz Kiepura (b. 1995, Poland) is a visual artist whose work is based on
    dynamic range of moods and movements, naturally carved setups of nature and
    urban life, discretion of temporary and constant reality. Working in the
    mediums of digital, analog and archival photography, Kiepura focuses on the
    untold quirks in the conversation between colour and composition. He is
    currently exploring the theme of relationship, mental health and belonging,
    searching for organic nuances of the world "in between".
